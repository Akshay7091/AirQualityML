\# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction



This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on date and country input. The pipeline uses Random Forest Regression and includes preprocessing steps to extract time-based features and encode categorical variables.



\## Project Structure



\- `project.py`: Contains the full code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

\- `data\_date.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model, containing date, country, and AQI values.



\## Features



1\) Converts date strings to datetime objects and extracts features such as year, month, day, day of week, and day of year.



2\) Uses one-hot encoding for the country column.



3\) Trains a RandomForestRegressor using scikit-learn's pipeline.



4\) Outputs performance metrics including MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².



5\) Demonstrates predictions for custom date and country inputs.
